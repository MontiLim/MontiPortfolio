### About Me
My name is Montipa Lim, but I prefer people to call me "Monti." I am a recent Cybersecurity graduate from GWU. I have been interested in Cybersecurity since high school. I am a Cyber-Security enthusiast, I am passionate about Network security, Secure DevOps, Incident response and Cyber Forensic which is why I persued a degree in this field.

### Why Cybersecurity?
As our society rapidly moving forward to Internet of Things (IoT), I have become more curious and interested of how this would effect us as a Cybersecurity profession and as a society. My question is how secure are we and maybe felt like my privacy has been a bit threaten. My passion about network security has grow as I learn more about IoT in cybersecurity perspective. Obviously, we cannot stop  technology from evolving, but as a cybersecurity graduate,we need to be aware and know how we can stay secure with these technologies that shaping our new way of life.
