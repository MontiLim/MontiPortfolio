### About Me
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Monti Lim, an Azure Storage Support Engineer with a strong cybersecurity background. Passionate about technology, particularly in the realm of cloud computing, my ultimate career goal is to continue working in the cloud computing field with a strong emphasis on security.

### Technical Side of things
With proficiency in Linux/Unix, Windows, Azure Network, Azure HPC Storage, Azure CLI, networking concepts, and various tools such as Wireshark, Mac OS, Virtual Box, and more, I bring a comprehensive skill set to the table. My expertise also extends to Azure AD, Active Directory, Citrix Director, project management, and incident response planning.

### Education:
I hold a B.A. in Cybersecurity from The George Washington University and an A.S. in Cybersecurity from Northern Virginia Community College. I have a passion for continuous learning and actively participated in the Colonials Cyber Club and the National Cyber League (NCL).

### Hobbies and Interests
When I am not working or studying, I always find myself planning for the next trip, whether it's a short getaway or a longer adventure, depending on the situation. Last year, I had the opportunity to visit several countries, which was truly eye-opening. I love the exhilarating feeling of exploring new places, immersing myself in different cultures, and constantly learning. In addition to my travel passion, I also enjoy spending quality time with my adorable furbaby. There's nothing quite like the joy and companionship that comes from being around my furry friend. Alongside that, I also find pleasure in cooking, gaming, eating out with friends, and engaging in small weekend projects.

### Why Cybersecurity?
As our society rapidly embraces IoT, I have become increasingly intrigued by its potential effects and how it may challenge us as cybersecurity professionals. This curiosity stems from my concern for security and privacy in this evolving landscape. As I delve into the cybersecurity aspects of Cloud Computing, IoT, AI, my passion for cloud security and data privacy continues to thrive. While we cannot halt technological progress, it is imperative that cybersecurity enthusiasts like me remain vigilant and well-informed about staying secure amidst these transformative technologies that are shaping our new way of life.

I am always open for new opportunities to grow.
