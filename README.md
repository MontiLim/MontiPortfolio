### About Me
My name is Montipa Lim, but I prefer people to call me "Monti." I am a recent Cybersecurity graduate from GWU. I have been interested in Cybersecurity since high school. I am a Cyber-Security enthusiast, I am passionate about Network security, Secure DevOps, Incident response and Cyber Forensic which is why I pursued a degree in this field.

When I am not working or studying, I always find myself planning for the next trip, short trip or long trip is depends on the situation. I have been to a a few countries last year and it has been an eye opening experience. I just love the feeling of being in new places, absorbing new cultures and learning new things. Other than I often find myself cooking, gaming, eating out with friends, finding little projects to do over the weekends.

### Why Cybersecurity?
As our society rapidly moving forward to Internet of Things (IoT), I have become more curious and interested of how this would effect us as a Cybersecurity profession and as a society. My question is how secure are we and maybe felt like my privacy has been a bit threaten. My passion about network security has grow as I learn more about IoT in cybersecurity perspective. Obviously, we cannot stop  technology from evolving, but as a cybersecurity graduate,we need to be aware and know how we can stay secure with these technologies that shaping our new way of life.

I am always open for new opportunities to grow.
