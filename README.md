## Monti Lim.
### About Me
My name is Montipa Lim, but I prefer people to call me "Monti." I am a recent Cybersecurity graduate from GWU. I have been interested in Cybersecurity sine high school. I has become more passionate about Secure DevOps, Incident response and Cyber Forensic which why I decided to persue a bachelor in this field.

### Why Cybersecurity?
As our society rapidly moving forward to Internet of Things (IoT), I have become more curious and interested of how this would effect us as a Cybersecurity profession and as a society. My question is how secure are we and maybe felt like my privacy has been a bit threaten. We cannot stop  technology from growing, but as a cybersecurity graduate,we need to be aware of how we stay secure with the new way of life.
